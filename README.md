Welcome to Quiz-Card!

Why did I build this project?
As a Computer Science teacher, I often give my students quizzes or mini-tests to test their understanding. I often found that it was quite a monotonous task getting them to take note of their wrong answers. It also became apparent they would never learn from their wrong answers as they never looked at them again!

So I decided that I would build an application where you create a custom quiz and it will create flashcards from any incorrect questions. This would solve the problem of students not being able to "store" their wrong answers and provides them with a more interactive way to learn from their mistakes.

Languages this will involve:
Python - for the back-end of the quiz app and flashcard creation
SQL - to store the flashcards
GUI e.g. tkinter or Django for making it as a website.


To do list:

1. Allows you to add questions to the app via csv - done
2. Allows you to add answers for the questions via csv- done
4. Can start the quiz and receive a score - done
5. Re-attempt the incorrect ones - done
6. Saves incorrect questions and answer as a flashcard - done
7. Saves the questions and answers with what you got wrong and right in a csv file 
8. Give feedback on questions wrong and save score
9. show progress over time using plot
10. Create a GUI to interact with quiz
    - Choose a quiz
    - Able to shuffle or play in order
    - Shows incorrect questions in separate tab and allows reattempt there.
    - Shows flashcards at end
